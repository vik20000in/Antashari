# 🎤 Word Challenge - Enhanced for Singing!

## What Changed ✅

### Word Challenge Mode is Now **Host-Friendly**:

**Before:**
- User had to type the song name
- No translation shown
- Felt like a guessing game

**Now:**
- ✅ Word displays in **BOTH Hindi AND English**
- ✅ User just **SINGS to the host** (no typing!)
- ✅ Host verifies if song contains the word
- ✅ Simple **"🎵 Next Word"** button for new challenges
- ✅ Clean, vocal-focused gameplay

## 🎯 How Word Challenge Works Now

### Step 1: Click "🎯 Word Challenge"
- Game starts, score shows 0

### Step 2: See the Word Challenge
```
Display shows:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│    "प्यार"                  │
│    (Love)                   │
│                             │
│ 🎤 Sing a song that        │
│    contains this word!      │
│                             │
│    [🎵 Next Word] Button   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3: User Sings to Host
- User hears the word "Love" (प्यार)
- User sings any song containing that word
- Host listens and verifies

### Step 4: Host Confirms
- If correct: Host clicks the check or just shares feedback
- If wrong or done: Host clicks "🎵 Next Word" for next word

### Step 5: Game Continues
- New random word appears
- User sings again
- Keep going!
